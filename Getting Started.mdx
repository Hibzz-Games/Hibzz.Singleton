---

This package contains a library of singletons that is ready to be used in Unity.

## Installation
**Via Package Manager:** This package can be installed in the Unity Package Manager using the following git URL.

```
https://github.com/hibzzgames/Hibzz.Singletons.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/hibzzgames/Hibzz.Singletons/releases) and manually import the package into your project.


## Basic Usage
The singleton classes are located inside the namespace `Hibzz.Singletons` and any of the Unity MonoBehaviors can be converted into a singleton using the following syntax.

```csharp
using Hibzz.Singletons;

public class AIManager : Singleton<AIManager>
{
    public int LiveNPCCount;
}
```

Now this Singleton can be accessed using the Instance field.

```csharp
int _currentNPCCount = AIManager.Instance.LiveNPCCount;
Debug.Log($"Number of Live NPC's in scene: {_currentNPCCount}");
```
